     <P>
     The <I>Device Tree Blob Importer</I> reconstructs memory map information
     from flattened device tree files (DTB or FDT files). Device Tree Blobs are
     binary representations of device tree source files used in embedded systems
     to describe hardware components and their memory mappings.
     </P>

     <H2>Usage</H2>
     <P>
     In order to import memory map information from device tree files, use the
     <B>Load DTB File...</B> item in the <B>File</B> menu. Select the DTB file
     from the file dialog, and the plugin will automatically parse the file and
     update the program's memory map.
     </P>

     <H2>What the Plugin Does</H2>
     <P>
     When a DTB file is loaded, the plugin performs the following actions:
     </P>
     <UL>
       <LI>Parses the DTB file to extract memory regions and peripheral information</LI>
       <LI>Creates or updates memory blocks in Ghidra's memory map with appropriate properties (read/write/execute/volatile)</LI>
       <LI>Adds symbols for peripheral blocks in the "Peripherals" namespace</LI>
       <LI>Creates data type structures for peripheral registers</LI>
       <LI>Applies data types to the corresponding memory locations</LI>
     </UL>

     <H2>Memory Block Properties</H2>
     <P>
     Memory blocks are created with properties inferred from the DTB:
     </P>
     <UL>
       <LI><B>Readable/Writable:</B> All blocks are marked as readable and writable</LI>
       <LI><B>Executable:</B> Blocks containing "RAM" or "memory" in their name are marked executable</LI>
       <LI><B>Volatile:</B> Non-executable blocks are marked as volatile</LI>
     </UL>

     <H2>Conflict Resolution</H2>
     <P>
     If a DTB memory region conflicts with an existing memory block:
     </P>
     <UL>
       <LI>If the regions are identical, the plugin may prompt to update the block's name and properties</LI>
       <LI>If there are conflicts, the plugin will skip creating the conflicting region and display a warning</LI>
     </UL>

     <P>
     <B>Note:</B> The plugin cannot load DTB files while auto-analysis is running.
     </P>
